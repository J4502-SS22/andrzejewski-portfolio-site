    <h2>Interests go here</h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Andrzejewski. Iâ€™m currently a student at the University of Missouri studying strategic communications via the journalism school. Given my background in all kinds of production including but not limited to photo, video and music, strategic communications has allowed me to hone my experiences in various softwares as well as apply myself to new techniques and strategic thinking mechanisms.</p>
<p>I use my musical talent to derive a sense of originality and diverge from the norm by providing custom sounds for multiple uses. Consistently trying to find ways to break the norm through creativity and originality.</p>
