		<p>In October of 2021, a member of Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity at the University of Missouri was a victim of alcohol hazing and suffered serious traumas. As the Interfraternity Council (IFC) Vice President of Public Relations, I was in charge of coordinating with the University to release a statement regarding the events that transpired at the Phi Gamma Delta house. This was the statement that was drafted and publicized on behalf of the IFC community.</p>

		<p>As a student, I was tasked with writing a mock press release for the City of Ballwin's trunk or treat event in late 2020. I was tasked with detailing the contents of the event as well as the current actions being taken in regards to the pandemic at the time.</p>

		<p>As the Vice President of Public Relations, I was tasked with creating the brand for the IFC social medias and events such as recruitment. I was given access to a database of photos of the University of Missouri and asked for photos from the 28 different organizations involved at the time to create a 3x2 Instagram graphic to showcase formal recruitment and highlight the most important values the community upholds. With the help of Mizzou's marketing team, we coordinated on the official logo and the torch was born. I used the logo as the forefront of the recruitment process.</p>
		You can view more of my works from IFC at the official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mizzouifc" target="_blank">Instagram account</a>; all posts and graphics created between December of 2020 to December of 2021 are mine! Some more notable campaigns included the Inclusion Initiative and the <strong>anti-hazing week awareness graphics</strong>.</p>

						<p>As co-director of internal philanthropy in the Delta Chi Missouri Chapter, I took charge of branding and publicization of our philanthropy efforts. I enjoyed creating the IFC 3x2 graphic so much that I wanted to do it again! I also created story graphics for members to post to gain publicization for the week prior to its beginning.
