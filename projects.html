		<p>In October of 2021, a member of Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity at the University of Missouri was a victim of alcohol hazing and suffered serious traumas. As the Interfraternity Council (IFC) Vice President of Public Relations, I was in charge of coordinating with the University to release a statement regarding the events that transpired at the Phi Gamma Delta house. This was the statement that was drafted and publicized on behalf of the IFC community.</p>

		<p>As the Vice President of Public Relations, I was tasked with creating the brand for the IFC social medias and events such as recruitment. I was given access to a database of photos of the University of Missouri and asked for photos from the 28 different organizations involved at the time to create a 3x2 Instagram graphic to showcase formal recruitment and highlight the most important values the community upholds. With the help of Mizzou's marketing team, we coordinated on the official logo and the torch was born. I used the logo as the forefront of the recruitment process.</p>
		You can view more of my works from IFC at the official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mizzouifc" target="_blank">Instagram account</a>; all posts and graphics created between December of 2020 to December of 2021 are mine! Some more notable campaigns included the Inclusion Initiative and the <strong>anti-hazing week awareness graphics</strong>.</p>

						<p>In the spring of 2022, I held the position of co-director of internal philanthropy in the Delta Chi Missouri Chapter. I took charge of branding and publicization of our philanthropy efforts. I took inspiration from my IFC 3x2 graphic and applied the nature of those posts to this 3x2 for the Jimmy V Foundation to spread awareness on social media. I also created story graphics for members to post to gain publicization for the week prior to its beginning.</p>

			<h3 id="writingpieces"><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wCFABLrCsc" target="_blank">My Time at Mizzou</a></strong></h3>
			<p>My first video project, with many flaws, still remains as one of my favorites. Over the first 1.5 years I spent studying at the University of Missouri, I gathered memories and collected videos to display this six-minute narrative of how I spent my time at the university and submitted it as a project for a digital storytelling class. I conveyed my story through the means of video, and I <em>developed the soundtrack for the video as well</em>. I think that, due to the focus I put onto the soundtack, the quality of the video may have faltered, but I am proud of it nonetheless.</p>

			<h3 id="writingpieces"><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZR2IaZhVQQ" target="_blank">Escape - A Short Film</a></strong></h3>
			<p>After the second summer of the pandemic, I wanted to jog inspiration and tell a wordless story about wanting to reconnect with nature after the work day. I used the help of my friend, Zach Earley, to portray my idea and once again, created my own original soundtrack to accompany the video. This was purely a passion project and was not turned in to any class.</p>

			<p>As a project in one of my classes, we were to demonstrate the use of a GoPro device with a topic of our choosing. I wanted to focus on the Mizzou Recreational Complex; I acquired the help of my friend, Nicholas Appelbaum, to record his workout routine and attach the GoPro to various machines and instruments found within the facility. The video was accompanied by a strategy sheet and several other graphics depicting a campaign strategy for the Rec.</p><br>
